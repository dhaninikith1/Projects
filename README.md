# Projects

1) Cache Simulator: 
Programming language: C
The goal of this project is to implement a Cache Simulator using the LRU replacement strategy. For each element in the array, you have go to the corresponding memory location and check if its a Miss or a Hit for different Associativities, Cache and Block Sizes.

2) Decision Trees:
Programming Language: Python
Implemented a Decision tree to detect the DNA sequences using various testing ML algorithms.

3) Graphics Pipeline:
Programming Language: C++
Translated and rotated the camera along its own axis using matrix multiplication and calculated the model-view matrix to render various images. Implemented my own projection matrix to calculate the pixel widht and length of the rendering picture.
Used GLSL to code the vertex shader and fragment shader. Followed up the project with unit testing approach to producing consistent and error-free code.

4) LoboGram:
Programming Language: NodeJS
Built a Lobogram to detect the different images based on their texture, followed up the project with unit testing to check it's functionality

5) MultiThreading:
Programming Language: C, Python
Designed the Jurassic park ride theme for the Universal Studios. Used multithreading concepts and implemented various threads for different functionalities of the ride and synchronized the threads together using C to keep a count of people at each ride. 
Simulated various graphs of the arrival, rejection and waiting data of the passengers using Pandas library in Python. 

6) Music_Classification:
Programming Language: Python
Classied 10 predetermined music genre files like Jazz, Classical, County, Pop, Metal, Rock and Reggae. Used the GTZAN dataset, which is frequently used to benchmark music genre classification tasks. The dataset contains the first 30
seconds of 100 songs per genre.The tracks are recorded at 22,050 Hz (22,050 readings per second) mono in the au format.
Designed a learning experiment capable of predicting music genres given their audio.

7) Huffman Codes:
Programming Language: C
Encoded and decoded a file with compression algorithm using huffman codes. 

8) Motor Controller:
Programming Language: C
The goal of this project is to simulate a reactor control system. We had three different tasks
to accomplish. The first task was control the servo motor armature position using an analog signal from
our voltage divider circuit. Varying the voltage level using a potentiometer varied the armature position
from -90 to 90 degrees. This simulated the reactor rods from a fully inserted position to a fully
withdrawn position. Task two was to monitor the temperature of the coolant using the TMP3 module.
The third task was to display the coolant temperature on the LCD display and to display the reactor
power level. The fourth task was to have one LED blink every second to indicate operation. The fifth task
was to send a status message to a terminal that displayed the run time, coolant temperature, and the
reactor power level. Lastly we had run emergency procedures if the temperature reached a threshold of
80 degrees F. The procedures were to insert the rods fully into the coolant, blink all 8 LEDâ€™s, and send
out a modified log signal to the terminal indicating a reactor scram. Once the temperature drops below
80 degrees F the systems behavior should return to normal.
